Percy makes it very simple to integrate visual regression testing for **static websites**, no matter what tools were used to generate it.

This can be especially useful for static sites generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (ie. for GitHub Pages), [Grow](http://growsdk.org), [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), or other static site generators.

## Installation

[!INCLUDE /docs/clients/-do-setup-first]

First, install the Percy command-line client:

```bash
$ gem install percy-cli
```

If you already have the client installed, you can update your old version by running:

```bash
$ gem update percy-cli
```

## Local testing

Percy CLI relies on the `PERCY_TOKEN` and `PERCY_PROJECT` environment variables for authenticating and authorizing access to each repository.

You can temporarily set these in your local shell session by exporting the variables:

```bash
$ export PERCY_TOKEN=aaabbbcccdddeeefff
$ export PERCY_PROJECT=my-org/my-project
$ percy snapshot _site/
```

Or you can set it just for the current command:

```bash
$ PERCY_TOKEN=aaabbbcccdddeeefff PERCY_PROJECT=my-org/my-project percy snapshot _site/
```

<div class="Alert Alert--warning">

**IMPORTANT: Keep your Percy token secret.** Anyone with access to your token can consume your account quota, though they cannot read data.

See the **Setup** guides for how to securely set environment variables in your CI service.

## Usage

If your static site exists in a directory called `_site`, it's as simple as this:

```bash
$ percy snapshot _site/
```

That's it!

For example:

```bash
$ percy snapshot _site/
Creating build...
Uploading build resources...
Uploading snapshot (1/3): /index.html
Uploading snapshot (2/3): /404.html
Uploading snapshot (3/3): /about/index.html
Finalizing build...
Done! Percy is now processing, you can view the visual diffs here:
https://percy.io/fotinakis/percy-examples/builds/140
```

Percy now starts rendering pages and generating visual diffs for your site. Under the hood, Percy only uploads files that have changed—so after the first time this command is run, future runs will be very fast.

### In a CI service

You can do the above steps locally for testing, but to get continuous visual integration for your static site you'll need to run the `gem install percy-cli` and `percy snapshot _site/` commands  as CI build steps for your project.

For example, in Travis CI, we can add these steps to `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
language: ruby
before_script:
  - gem install jekyll
  - gem install percy-cli
script:
  - jekyll build
  - percy snapshot _site/
```

The steps will be similar when configuring other CI services or other static site generators.

### Responsive testing

You can use Percy [responsive visual diffs](/docs/learn/responsive) to test pages at different CSS breakpoints. Just pass the `--widths` flag with a comma-separated list of widths.

```bash
$ percy snapshot --widths "375,1280" _site/
```

### Limit pages for testing

If you have a very large site, you might want to limit the number of pages that are actually uploaded to Percy while testing. You can pass the `snapshot_limit` flag to do this:

```bash
$ percy snapshot _site/ --snapshot_limit 10
```

### Base URL path

If your static files are hosted in a sub-directory instead of the webserver root, you will need to provide the `--baseurl` flag:

```bash
$ percy snapshot _site/ --baseurl "/my-subdir"
```

For Jekyll users, this should be set to the same as your `baseurl` config setting.
